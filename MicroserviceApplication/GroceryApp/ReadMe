##To deploy application using docker compose

#for nginx container we have to edit deafault.conf file 
#we have mentioned this in docker-compose.yml

volumes:
        - ./nginx/default.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf

# create a file named default.conf in nginx folder and add the following code
# this file is used to configure nginx to route traffic to the frontend and backend services
# and also to serve static files from the frontend service
# the frontend service is running on port 3000 and the backend service is running on port 5000
# the nginx server is running on port 80
# the nginx server will route traffic to the frontend service for all requests except for /api/* requests
# which will be routed to the backend service
# the nginx server will also serve static files from the frontend service

# default.conf file

server {
    listen 80;

    location /api/ {
        proxy_pass http://grocery-backend:5000/;
    }

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://grocery-frontend:3000/;
    }
}


# for mongo container change in .env file 
# we have to change the mongo connection string in the .env file of grocery-backend service
# the connection string is used to connect to the mongoDB database
# the connection string is in the following format
# mongodb://<username>:<password>@mongo:27017/<database_name>?authSource=admin
